👋 Hi, I’m Ashish Trivedi

Senior Data Engineer | AI-First Data Platforms | MLOps & LLM Systems
📍 **India** | 🌍 **Building scalable, production-grade data & AI systems**

I’m a seasoned Data Engineer (10+ years) with deep expertise in designing, building, and operating large-scale data platforms—now focused on AI-driven systems, LLM applications, and MLOps.

My work sits at the intersection of data engineering, applied AI, and platform reliability, helping organizations move from raw data → intelligence → business impact.

🚀 **Current Focus Areas**

LLM Systems: RAG architectures, vector databases, prompt-to-SQL, AI-driven analytics

AI Data Platforms: Databricks, Spark, cloud-native lakehouse design

MLOps & DevOps: Model serving, CI/CD, Kubernetes-based deployments

AI Product Enablement: Turning AI prototypes into production-ready systems

🧠 **What I Bring to the Table**

End-to-end data pipeline architecture (batch + streaming)

Production-grade ETL/ELT using PySpark & SQL at scale

Cloud-native design across AWS, Azure, and Databricks

LLM-powered applications (Text-to-SQL, RAG, Vector Search)

Operational excellence: observability, cost optimization, reliability

Strong bias toward clean architecture, maintainability, and scalability
